# SFS In-game Texture Maker
Creates a window in the build menu that will allow you to create new textures based on hex color values.

# Important
You will need to reload the game to be able to use the textures. I will work on making the game load these textures or create my own loader, but I can't guarantee it.

# How to Use
- To input a color, type in a hex value (without the #, but it doesn't matter). There are many hex value websites available: [Color Picker](https://redketchup.io/color-picker).

- Click the "Make Texture" button, and it should be added to the list if it's correct. You may have to press the button twice as the UI may misalign.

- To remove a color/texture, click on it in the window, and it will delete (there is no warning).
